  1. CSV Log for Analytics

Add logs/system.csv to store each call in rows.

Easier to open in Excel or Pandas for dashboards.

2. Real-Time (Streaming) Mode

Right now, you process the whole file after it finishes.

We can make it process audio chunks while caller speaks → near real-time detection.

Vosk supports streaming recognition.

Could even update distress level live (like a dashboard meter).

3. Priority Queue System

Right now, we just print distress.

Next: push each call into a priority queue:

Peak distress = priority 1

High distress = priority 2

Medium distress = priority 3

Low distress = priority 4

Then dispatchers pick calls in correct order.

We could simulate this with Python queue.PriorityQueue.

4. Dispatcher Dashboard (Optional UI)

Build a simple web dashboard (Flask + HTML/React) that shows:

Incoming call ID

Transcript (live updating)

Emotion & distress level

Queue position

Dispatchers can click “Connect” to talk to caller.

5. Keyword/Context Detection

Add a module that scans transcript for critical words like:

“fire”, “heart attack”, “bleeding”, “not breathing”, “gunshot”

Boosts distress level even if emotion model says otherwise.

Example:

Transcript: “My father is not breathing” → immediate PEAK.

6. Sound Event Detection

Go beyond speech → detect background events:

Explosion

Crying

Alarm sounds

Could use YAMNet (Google) or custom trained model.

7. Multilingual Support

Vosk has models for Hindi, Arabic, Spanish, etc.

We can let caller choose language or auto-detect.

8. Model Fine-Tuning

If you collect some real/emulated emergency calls,

Fine-tune wav2vec2 & RoBERTa on those → better accuracy.
